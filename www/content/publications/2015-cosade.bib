  abstract     = "We present \textsc{Zorro}, a taped-out ASIC hosting three
                  distinct authenticated encryption architectures based on the
                  \textsc{SpongeWrap} construction. All designs target
                  resource-constrained environments such as smart cards or
                  embedded devices and therefore, have been protected against
                  DPA attacks while keeping low-area as the most important
                  design goal in mind. Each of the three architectures contains
                  masking and hiding countermeasures. They solely differ with
                  regard to the implemented secret-sharing scheme. While the
                  first design is based on a 3-share threshold implementation
                  (TI), which does not fulfill the uniformity property, the
                  other two make use of the 3-share approach with re-masking and
                  the 4-share approach as proposed by Bilgin~et~al. Our
                  smallest, provable first-order DPA secure \textsc{Keccak}
                  implementation requires only 14.5\,kGE (which is less than
                  half of the size of related work) and contains both front-end
                  and back-end design overheads. Moreover, we present first DPA
                  results of the \textsc{Zorro} ASIC by comparing hiding and
                  masking countermeasures. We were able to recover the cipherkey
                  from a masking-secured TI implementation based on three shares
                  with about 70\,000 power traces."
