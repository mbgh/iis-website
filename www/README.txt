This README contains some information about the public version of my personal
website at the Integrated Systems Laboratory (IIS).


***** CSS Style Sheet *****

Two different CSS styles sheets are currently available:

style.css - The actual file I am using to format my content (including comments,
  indents, etc.)
style.css.min - The minimalistic CSS style sheet obtained from running it
  through Google's PageSpeed Insights [1] tool. This should actually be used
  when uploading a new and stable public version of my website.
