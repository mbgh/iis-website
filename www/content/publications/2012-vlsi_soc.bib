  abstract     = "We propose a block-cipher-based hardware
                  architecture for authenticated encryption (AE)
                  applications supporting the Ethernet standard IEEE
                  802.3ba. Our main design goal was to achieve high
                  throughput on FPGA platforms. Compared to previous
                  works aiming at data rates beyond 100\,Gbit/s, our
                  design makes use of an alternative block cipher and
                  an alternative mode of operation, namely Serpent and
                  the offset codebook mode of operation,
                  respectively. Using four cipher cores for the
                  encryption part of the AE architecture, we achieve a
                  throughput of 133\,Gbit/s on an Altera Stratix IV
                  FPGA. The design requires 30\,kALMs and runs at a
                  maximum clock frequency of 260\,MHz. This
                  represents, to the best of our knowledge, the
                  fastest full implementation of an AE scheme on FPGAs
