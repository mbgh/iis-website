  abstract     = "We present the results of a Swiss project dedicated
                  to the development of high speed quantum key
                  distribution and data encryption. The QKD engine
                  features fully automated key exchange, hardware key
                  distillation based on finite key security analysis,
                  efficient authentication and wavelength division
                  multiplexing of the quantum and the classical
                  channel and one-time pas encryption. The encryption
                  device allows authenticated symmetric key encryption
                  (e.g AES) at rates of up to 100 Gb/s. A new quantum
                  key can uploaded up to 1000 times second from the
                  QKD engine.",
