  abstract     = "We present Gr\AE Stl, a combined hardware
                  architecture for the Advanced Encryption Standard
                  (AES) and Gr{\o}stl, one of the final round
                  candidates of the SHA-3 hash competition. Gr\AE Stl
                  has been designed for low-resource devices
                  implementing AES-128 (encryption and decryption) as
                  well as Gr{\o}stl-256 (tweaked version). We applied
                  several resource-sharing optimizations and based our
                  design on an 8/16-bit datapath. As a feature, we aim
                  for high flexibility by targeting both ASIC and FPGA
                  platforms and do not include technology or
                  platform-dependent components such as RAM macros,
                  DSPs, or Block RAMs. Our ASIC implementation
                  (fabricated in a 0.18\,$\mu$m CMOS process) needs
                  only 16.5\,kGEs and requires 742/1,025\,{clock
                  cycles} for encryption/decryption and 3,093\,clock
                  cycles for hashing one message block. On a Xilinx
                  Spartan-3 FPGA, our design requires 956\,{logic
                  slices} and 302\,{logic slices} on a Xilinx
                  Virtex-6. Both stand-alone implementations of AES
                  and Gr{\o}stl outperform existing FPGA solutions
                  regarding low-area design by needing 79\,\% and
                  50\,\% less resources as compared to existing
                  work. Gr\AE Stl is the first combined AES and
                  Gr{\o}stl implementation that has been fabricated as
                  an ASIC.",
