  abstract     = "We propose a block-cipher-based hardware
                  architecture for authenticated encryption (AE)
                  applications supporting the Ethernet standard
                  IEEE~802.3ba. Our main design goal was to achieve
                  high throughput on FPGA platforms. Compared to
                  previous works aiming at data rates beyond
                  100\,Gbit/s, our design makes use of an alternative
                  block cipher and an alternative mode of operation,
                  namely Serpent and the offset codebook mode of
                  operation, respectively. Using four cipher cores for
                  the encryption part of the AE architecture, we
                  achieve a throughput of 141\,Gbit/s on an Altera
                  Stratix IV FPGA. The design requires 39\,kALMs and
                  runs at a maximum clock frequency of 275\,MHz. This
                  represents, to the best of our knowledge, the
                  fastest full implementation of an AE scheme on FPGAs
                  to date. Moreover, we present a custom-designed
                  printed circuit board for the Stratix IV FPGA which
                  allows us to use our AE designs in real-world
                  applications.",
