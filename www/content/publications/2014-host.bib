  abstract     = "The detectability of malicious circuitry on FPGAs
                  with varying placement properties yet has to be
                  investigated. The authors utilize a Xilinx Virtex-II
                  Pro target platform in order to insert a sequential
                  denial-of-service Trojan into an existing AES design
                  by manipulating a Xilinx-specific, intermediate file
                  format prior to the bitstream generation. Thereby,
                  there is no need for an attacker to acquire access
                  to the hardware description language representation
                  of a potential target architecture. Using a
                  side-channel analysis setup for electromagnetic
                  emanation (EM) measurements, they evaluate the
                  detectability of different Trojan designs with
                  varying location and logic distribution
                  properties. The authors successfully distinguish the
                  malicious from the genuine designs and provide
                  information on how the location and distribution
                  properties of the Trojan logic affect its
                  detectability. To the best of their knowledge, this
                  has been the first practically conducted Trojan
                  detection using localized EM measurements.",
