  abstract     = "The weakening of the widely used SHA-1 hash function
                  has also cast doubts on the strength of the related
                  algorithms of the SHA-2 family. The US NIST has
                  therefore initiated the SHA-3 competition in order
                  to select a modern hash function algorithm as a
                  ``backup'' for SHA-2. This algorithm should be
                  efficiently implementable both in software and
                  hardware under different constraints. In this paper,
                  we present hardware implementations of the four
                  SHA-3 candidates ARIRANG, BLAKE, Gr{\o}stl, and
                  Skein with the primary constraint of minimizing chip
