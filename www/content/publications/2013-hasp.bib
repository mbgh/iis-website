  abstract     = "We infiltrate the ASIC development chain by
                  inserting a small denial-of-service (DoS) hardware
                  Trojan at the fabrication design phase into an
                  existing VLSI circuit, thereby simulating an
                  adversary at a semiconductor foundry. Both the
                  genuine and the altered ASICs have been fabricated
                  using a 180\,nm CMOS process. The Trojan circuit
                  adds an overhead of only 0.5\,\% to the original
                  design. In order to detect the hardware Trojan, we
                  perform side-channel analyses and apply
                  IC-fingerprinting techniques using templates,
                  principal component analysis (PCA), and support
                  vector machines (SVMs). As a result, we were able to
                  successfully identify and classify all infected
                  ASICs from non-infected ones. To the best of our
                  knowledge, this is the first hardware Trojan
                  manufactured as an ASIC and has successfully been
                  analyzed using side channels.",
