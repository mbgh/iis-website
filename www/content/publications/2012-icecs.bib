  abstract     = "Compressed sensing allows to reconstruct sparse
                  signals sampled at sub-Nyquist rates. However,
                  reconstruction of the original signal requires high
                  computational effort, even for problems of moderate
                  size. Especially for applications with real-time
                  requirements, software realizations are not fast
                  enough. We therefore present generic high-speed FPGA
                  implementations of two fast reconstruction
                  algorithms: orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and
                  approximate message passing (AMP). Our
                  implementations also support less sparse signals,
                  which makes them suitable for, e.g., image
                  reconstruction. The two implementations are
                  optimized for highly parallel processing on FPGAs
                  and have similar hardware structures, which allows
                  comparisons in terms of resource usage and
                  performance.",
