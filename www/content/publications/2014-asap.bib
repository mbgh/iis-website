  abstract     = "Today's embedded systems require resource-aware
                  acceleration engines, which support advanced
                  cryptographic algorithms such as elliptic-curve
                  cryptography (ECC). The authors present an
                  application-specific co-processor for digital
                  signature verification according to the Elliptic
                  Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) based on
                  the NIST B-233 standard. A novel OpenRISC-ISA
                  (instruction-set architecture) core featuring a high
                  IPC rate and balanced pipeline stages has been
                  developed to act as the main controlling unit of the
                  accelerator. The redesigned OpenRISC core processes
                  67\% more instructions per second than the reference
                  architecture and ties with a micro-controllable ECC
                  datapath through a highly optimized interface. An
                  ECDSA signature is verified in 11\,ms, which is
                  equal to a speedup of $15\times$ and $3.3\times$
                  with respect to a portable C implementation on the
                  OpenRISC and an assembler-optimized implementation
                  on an ARM7, respectively. Moreover, thanks to a
                  tightly coupled data memory, the proposed
                  co-processor does not block the OpenRISC during its
                  ECC-specific operations, thereby enabling it to also
                  support concurrent execution of other workloads
                  and/or software-based cryptographic extension
                  functions.",
