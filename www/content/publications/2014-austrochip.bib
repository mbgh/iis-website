  abstract     = "We investigate different ASIC hardware designs of
                  binary-field multipliers with large operand sizes
                  (>1000 bits). Our architectures target
                  resource-constrained environments such as embedded
                  smart cards or contactless-powered devices and
                  evaluate their applicability. We present several
                  different design strategies based on an iterative
                  Karatsuba, a digit-serial, and a bit-serial
                  multiplier. Based on a cryptographic pairing example
                  application, a total of seven architectures are
                  evaluated in terms of area requirement, speed, and
                  power consumption. Each architecture was subject to
                  a full back-end design flow providing detailed
                  results for synthesis, post-layout, and for an
                  'effective chip' giving realistic design-cost
                  numbers. Providing detailed design flow results, we
                  show that basically all designs exhibit a
                  significant increase in area during their back-end
                  design phase, which can certainly not be considered
                  as negligible.",
